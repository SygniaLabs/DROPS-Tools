# DROPS-Tools
Are you tired of creating and managing your own cheat sheets for the various tools you use in your day-to-day work? Do you find yourself copying, editing, and pasting commands to achieve the desired outcome?

Introducing [DROPS](https://sygnialabs.github.io/DROPS), a dynamic cheat sheet for CLI tools that saves you time by generating the commands for you, without the need to modify templates from static cheat sheets. With DROPS, you no longer need to remember all the parameters and flags for each individual tool you use, and it even allows you to share the same parameter values across different tools.
